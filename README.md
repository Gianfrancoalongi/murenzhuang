===========

Mu Ren Zhuang is an exercise form to practice Code Flexibility - something I have not seen before.
I recommend reading the [Wiki] [1] and/or watching the [introductory youtube video] [2].

If you want to get doing immediately, you can always download the latest release, 
choose either the [tar] [3] version or the [zip] [4] version.
