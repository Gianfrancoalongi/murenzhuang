===========

Mu Ren Zhuang is an exercise form to practice Code Flexibility - something I have not seen before.

If you want to get doing immediately, you can 
* download the latest release, choose either the [tar] [3] version or the [zip] [4] version.
* watch the [introductory youtube video] [2] detailing the system as a whole
* watch the [mutator walkthrough video] [5] that guides you through a mutator and how it's intended to be interpreted 

For more details in depth, you can read the [Wiki] [1]
